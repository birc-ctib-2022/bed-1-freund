How does your method for extracting features work?
    The algorithm checks if the start position of the feature is between
    the positions that have been given in the query. If this is the case,
    the chromosome is printed to the user.

What is the complexity of the algorithm, as a function of the size of the two 
input files? 
When you answer this, you need to know that you can get the list of chromosomes 
from a query.Table in constant time, but it does, of course, take longer to run 
through all the lines in it.
    The file containing the chromosomes with their features has to be parsed,
    and we have to run through the file containing the queries; 
    assuming that the query table is accessed in constant time, we should 
    get a complexity of O(n+m)

Did you, at any point, exploit that our features are on single nucleotides and not larger regions?
    I've tried to avoid this, and attempted to make the algorithm as general
    as possible.

If you did, what would it take to handle general regions?
